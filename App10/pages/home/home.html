                    <img src="../../pics/bikes%20(3).jpg" alt="2013 BMW S1000RR HP4 Price: $19,990 How exactly can we include a $20,000 motorcycle in a group of best buys? It's because BMW's new HP4 offers technology that no other motorcycle does—at any price. The HP4 model builds on the S1000RR's breakthrough electronics, which included Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), a system that allowed for tremendous performance and safety envelope. For the HP4, the DTC system has been massaged to operate more fluidly and now offers more than a dozen different settings."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/bikes%20(4).jpg" alt="Harley-Davidson Iron 883 Price: $7999 Even for a manufacturer like Harley-Davidson, which trades on its old-fashioned reputation, the Dark Custom series is like a time machine back to when motorcycles were the transportation of rebels. Back then, custom bikes were more raw and less flashy than today's chrome-plated luxo-cruisers. These new bikes ape that look with bobbed fenders, a hunkered-down stance, and flat paint finish. They've got blacked-out trim and lots of retro touches, too. But if you want the top dog Blackline, which is based on the Softail, it'll run you close to $16,000. Woof."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/bikes%20(5).jpg" alt="Star Stryker Price: $11,090 The Star Stryker is the most expensive bike on this list, but when it comes to long and low chopper-style cruisers, this one is a bargain. It undercuts Honda's Fury by more than two grand and competitive Harley-Davidsons by thousands more. The Stryker's big torque, which comes courtesy of its potent 1304cc, liquid-cooled V-twin, allows it to lope easily away from the line. And though it has some serious rake (40 degrees), the Stryker feels better connected to the road than most in the class."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/bikes%20(6).jpg" alt="Kawasaki Ninja 250 Price: $3999 In terms of thrills per dollar, the Kawasaki Ninja 250R is one of the best bargains of them all. This little guy is really fun to ride. The tiny 250cc parallel twin spins to a ludicrous 10,000 rpm and sounds sweet doing it.Okay, so it's not fast. But it will hit 60 mph in about 7 seconds, so it's not exactly slow either. On the twisty roads, this bike handles beautifully—it's willing to play hard just like larger sportbikes. But beware; it's not a relaxing ride. The pocketsize Ninja is buzzy on the freeway."/>

There's a good reason: BMW invented the breed nearly 30 years ago. But today there are plenty of competitors building adventure bikes that bridge the gap between street motorcycle and off-road dual-sport, by offering decent off-road capability while still providing long-range touring ability. Think of them as the SUVs of the motorcycle word, only a lot easier to park and considerably more fun."/>

The V7 Racer uses an updated 744-cc V-twin with more compression and an improved fuel-injection system, but it's still a little underpowered at just 50 hp."/>

                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_fallout.jpg" alt="The 1950s were a time of authentic fear for a world embroiled in a Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Nuclear bombardment and mutually assured destruction peeked around every corner, and many people didn't wonder if an exchange would happen, but when it would and how everything would look afterwards. Such a culture left a lasting effect on the world, and it's that post-war what-if that rests at the heart of the Fallout franchise.Of course, things in Fallout go a little bit differently. The aesthetics and inspiration of 1950's America remains firmly implanted everywhere well into the 21st century, and the aforementioned cataclysm doesn't happen in the 1950's, but rather in 2077 when China and the United States go at it. The result of the conflict - which only lasted two hours - was a world crushed under the weight of radioactivity. Thus, Fallout as we know and love it was born, putting us on Earth with a small fraction of its former population density, quarreling governments, mutated creatures and a dog-eat-dog mentality that puts everyone born in immediate and very real danger."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_elder-scrolls.jpg" alt="We here at IGN are pretty hard pressed to find a more intricate video game world than that found in The Elder Scrolls. Taking place on the planet of Nirn, the series so far has narrowed its focus on the content of Tamriel. From Morrowind to Summerset Isles, we've walked every square inch of the land taking in adventures large and small. Most recently our trip to Tamriel had us focusing on the region of Skyrim - with its picturesque landscapes and magical creatures of myth.The Elder Scrolls world isn't just defined by the scope of the landscape however. The characters, literature, languages, wildlife, history, and overall culture of the world are what make the series so special. Sure, you can jump in at any point to The Elder Scrolls series, but after playing all the games you realize that its world is nearly as complex as our own. If you're a fan of mythology-heavy worlds, and fantastic adventure then this is world for you."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_zelda.jpg" alt="The world of Hyrule has undergone many changes over the past 25 years. It's evolved from the original, 8-bit adventure to the dual worlds of A Link to the Past to the majestic, 3D realization of Ocarina of Time to the painterly vistas of Skyward Sword, with plenty of other interpretations of Link's home town rounding out the package. One thing all these incarnations share is their ability to instill a sense of wonderment in gamers, and to almost magically transport you from your couch to the living, breathing world of Hyrule. Full of kooky inhabitants, memorable locations, a sprawling/epic backstory and countless pots for the breaking, few game worlds manage to leave as indelible an impression on the collective gaming subconscious as Zelda has. For that alone it ranks up there as one of the best, most fully realized worlds in all of gaming."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_final-fantasy-vi.jpg" alt="There was a time when the Final Fantasy series wasn't about shallow gameplay and forgettable characters, but rather about an amazing cast placed in an awesome setting. And the best Final Fantasy game ever created - Final Fantasy VI - happens to have not one, but two of the best settings in the entire franchise. Unfortunately, the SNES didn't have the graphical capabilities to render exactly what Square's artists wanted you to see, so a little imagination was required. When you finally got a grasp on just what the worlds you were looking at were trying to be, however, it was hard not to be floored.Steampunk to its core but retaining much of the fantasy-based inspiration the series had always been known for, Final Fantasy VI's world is made all the more rich by its diverse set of towns and cities, each with its own identity. From backwoods villages to industrial havens, Final Fantasy VI had it all. Of course, halfway through the game everything is turned upside down by a cataclysmic event, which makes Final Fantasy VI and its setting truly special. After all, not every game lets you get to explore the entire world both before and after it's utterly destroyed."/>

                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_diablo.jpg" alt="The world of Blizzard's action-RPG is really kind of depressing. It's full of murder-obsessed demons that want nothing more than to corrupt and slaughter humanity. The story was never conveyed very well, which was mostly about carving up hordes of monsters and stockpiling the dropped loot. Non-playable characters stood around towns delivering goofy voice over through text boxes while you had to do all the hard work, clearing dungeons and beating up ultra-powerful boss characters. Then every once in a while, a pre-rendered cinematic triggered to remind you that there was an actual overarching story."/>

Morality wasn't something men built laws on, it was something they flexed for the greater good of the people. Experimentation created a super-powered human sub-species. Experimentation also drove the populous mad enough to murder. BioShock's world sets a terrific stage, features unforgettable events, and leaves everything in ruin -- all before we even arrive. Players learn about the world by proxy and critical thought. Rapture forces those who want to learn about its gorgeous horror to think about what they're seeing, consider who they're talking to, and really take everything in. You discover the depths willingly. Rapture doesn't just happen to you -- it demands to be consumed"/>
                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_mass-effect.jpg" alt="Despite the vocal opposition from the game's fanbase about Mass Effect 3's ending, we still find the world within this ambitious space opera to be one of the very best ever conceived in the video game medium.Whether you like your science fiction to be more character focused and intimate, or whether you want it to feature lots of aliens, space ships and epic battles, Mass Effect has created a game with something for everybody. Through Commander Shepard, your avatar in this complex world, you meet alien races with their own unique cultures, go to planets with landscapes unknown to our world, uncover vast political plots which could mean the end of the universe, and still end up with the girl (or guy). The series pushes boundaries in nearly every way, so much so that it has opened doors to explore its intricacies and characters in movies and comics."/>
                    <img src="../../pics/top-50-game-worlds_warcraft.jpg" alt="What started out as a simple backdrop for an early real-time strategy game has become one of the most fleshed out video game universes. Despite adhering to a number of fantasy tropes, the Warcraft world has come into its own in recent years. Warcraft's stories and developing narrative have ensconced players in a world where war is constant, where heroes are born, and where they have the power to help participate in its history. From the fall and rise (and fall) of Prince Arthas, to the wrath wrought by the return of DeathWing, the WarCraft universe has allowed countless players to live and have a role in shaping a virtual world that's enchanted people from all walks of life."/>

Sure, the mystical side of the series is nutty fun, but the joy of exploring, interacting with, and living in actual human history inspires awe in players. The prospect of climbing to the top of a real-life landmark like the Coliseum, stalking Templars in Damascus, and sprinting through a Revolution-era Boston appeals to the interests of history nerds and adventurous minds alike. We get to be part of real-life events and work with long-lost legends in some of Earth's most incredible places. Assassin's Creed is a proxy to see the globe -- for those of us who will never actually get to visit The Vatican, this is the next best thing."/>
